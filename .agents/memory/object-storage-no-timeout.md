name: Object Storage client has no built-in timeout
description: Why @replit/object-storage calls must be wrapped in a timeout race inside any request path
---

The `@replit/object-storage` `Client` (`uploadFromBytes` / `downloadAsBytes` /
`delete`) has **no client-side timeout**. A stalled bucket call therefore awaits
forever, hanging the whole HTTP request — the symptom is a UI control stuck in a
pending state (e.g. thumbnail upload frozen on "Uploading…") with no success and no
error, because the response never arrives.

**Why this bites specifically:** non-Production tiers always use Object Storage (Drive
is gated to production tiers), so they never benefit from the Drive path's existing
12s cap. The Object-Storage fallback was the *only* backend for those members and it
was unbounded.

**Same applies to Prisma/Neon:** Prisma queries have **no default statement
timeout**, so a degraded Neon connection hangs ANY `await prisma.*` (reads,
`resolveUserFromSession`, and interactive `$transaction`s) indefinitely — not just
Object Storage. Bounding only the storage call is not enough: an upload route that
timed out at the client's 40s mark *after* a 15s storage bound proved the hang had
moved to the unbounded DB awaits. Wrap every DB await in a request path too.

**Reusable helper:** `src/lib/with-timeout.ts` — `withTimeout(work, {phase, subsystem,
timeoutMs})` races against a timeout and throws a `PhaseTimeoutError` tagged with a
`subsystem` (storage|database|upload|drive|other) so the route can return a precise
member-facing message and log `result=timeout timeout_at=<phase>`.

**Per-phase bounds are NOT enough — also need an OVERALL request bound.** Several
phases each slow-but-under-their-own-bound can SUM past the client's abort timeout,
which the client sees as a forever-hang (it shows its own abort message, e.g.
"Upload timed out", NOT any server `*is slow*` message). Diagnostic tell: client
abort message instead of a structured 503/408 = cumulative overrun, not a single
hung phase. Fix: wrap the whole handler in one `withTimeout` (phase `request_total`,
~35s, comfortably under the client's 40s) as the binding SLA; keep per-phase bounds
only for diagnostic attribution. Accepted tradeoff: when the overall bound fires,
in-flight background work may finish after the response and orphan a harmless object.

**How to apply:**
- Wrap every Object-Storage call that runs inside a request path in a
  `Promise.race` against a timeout (the thumbnail helpers use a ~15s bound).
- The route must also return a **structured JSON** error on failure — an unhandled
  throw yields a non-JSON 500 that the client's `res.json()` then chokes on, masking
  the real error.
- Add a client-side `AbortController` timeout on the fetch as defense-in-depth so a
  network/proxy stall can't hang the control even if the server somehow doesn't reply.
- Same rule for Drive helpers: any `drive.files.*` call awaited in a request path
  (including best-effort cleanup like `deleteDriveFile`) must be timeout-bounded.
